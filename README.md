# Predict-Heart-Disease
Heart Disease Prediction
📋 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical features. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk and take preventive or corrective action.

🧠 Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Early diagnosis can significantly reduce risks and improve outcomes. This project focuses on using historical patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using classification models.

📁 Dataset
File Name: 4. Predict Heart Disease.csv

Description: This dataset contains medical data for multiple patients, including attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more.

Example Features (inferred from standard heart disease datasets):
age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type (0–3)

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2)

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise

target: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

Note: Exact columns may vary. Please refer to the dataset for full feature details.

🎯 Objectives
Load and explore the dataset

Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.)

Visualize data for better insights

Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Tune hyperparameters for the best model

Provide a final model for deployment or further analysis
